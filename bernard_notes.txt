NOTES

11/1:
Worked on implementing state machine for turn signals. Working as of now (with
left turn ble button press being simulated with button0 on buckler). Pressing
the button transitions state to left and doing either button0 or tilt_left or
leaving it for 60 seconds makes it turn off.

Also sampling acceleration from mpu9250 instead of from the analog adxl327.

Also ordered hall-effect sensors for next time. Need to calculate velocity
(because we can't accurately get velocity from acceleration)

Problems:
Investigate why app_timer_init() stuff needs ble to be initialized?
Look into getting an LED matrix panel and hooking that up.
Abstract out methods even further (into their own .h and .c files)
Implement velocity readings from hall-effect sensors.

Did some work on BLE
Big idea: need to use Nordic BLE API to scan for peripherals and connect
to the button as a periperal. Discover the characteristics and monitor which
one corresponds to a button press.
(The nRF app on the phone is acting as a central, discovers peripherals
and connects. Finds characteristics and stuff, we need to do that)

Flic button macs : 80:e4:da:73:b4:50, 80:e4:da:73:b6:8d

Moved the actual main.c -> ../old.c
main.c is now just ble_adv_listen_template/main.c
